	"1": "Perixosome Proliferator Activated Receptor Gamma (PPAR&gamma;) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that acts as a tumor suppressor in many cancers and regulates adipocyte differentiation. PPAR&gamma; exhibited anti-cancer activities in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, conditional knockout of PPAR&gamma; in the prostatic epithelium of mice resulted in focal hyperplasia which developed into mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN), a precursor of prostate cancer. Preliminary data from our lab suggests that the androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), regulates PPAR&gamma; expression in the androgen independent prostate cancer cell line C42. The mechanism by which DHT suppresses PPAR&gamma; remains to be elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRs) actively participate in the progression of many cancers by pairing with messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of tumor suppressors and inhibiting the expression of their proteins. Previous studies have shown that miR-27a and miR-27b target the PPAR&gamma; mRNA and inhibits its expression. We report that androgens via the androgen receptor facilitate the production of miR-27a and miR-27b. The basal levels of both miRs vary across the human prostate cancer cell lines: PC-3, 22RV-1 and C4-2. These data suggest that androgens regulate PPAR&gamma; expression by inducing the production of miR-27a and miR-27b, thereby promoting the proliferation of prostate cancer cells.",
	"2": "Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American men. Aberrant regulations of multiple genes and pathways are found in prostate cancer. EZH2 and H3K27me3 are abnormally up regulated in prostate cancer. Here we show that TSUA-58, a derivative of TSUA-58 alkaloids, on it's own, suppresses the proliferation of C4-2B and PC-3 cells. We discover for the first time that TSUA-58 decreases H3K27me3 to suppress cancer cell proliferation. Findings of this project will point out new research directions in which a novel chemotherapy can be generated to treat prostate cancer.",
	"3": "In the event of lethal radiation exposure, knowledge of the radiation dose received is important for appropriate medical treatment. There are currently no effective biodosimeters for determining dose. The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) relative to absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) has been proposed as a tool for early assessment of radiation dose due to the greater radiosensitivity of ALC relative to ANC. Early administration of a pegylated-granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (peg-G-CSF, Neulasta), will likely impact the ANC:ALC ratio. For instance, non-human primate (NHP) studies show a more rapid decline in ANC after administration of Neulasta, in apparent contrast to Neulasta's ability to significantly enhance survival. In this study, we investigated whether 1) the same rapid decline of ANC occurs in lethally-irradiated mice treated with Neulasta, and 2) whether Neulasta acts by expanding bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC), or whether stimulation of HPC by Neulasta leads to their depletion. To this end, lethally-irradiated (8.62 Gy) mice (n=34) were injected subcutaneously with 1mg/kg Neulasta 24 hours post-irradiation, and subgroups analyzed on set time points for: 1) complete blood cell counts (CBC), and 2) BM HPC. Results show that in contrast to NHP, the ANC was 2 and 4-fold higher in Neulasta mice than controls on days 2 and 3 respectively, but dropped to below control ANC on days 4 and 7. ANC in Neulasta mice significantly increased thereafter. Results of HPC assays show that Neulasta-treated mice possessed more BM HPC than vehicle-treated mice and Neulasta-treated mice had a higher ANC:ALC ratio.",

Proper and intentional design and tailor of the materials structure at nanoscale may hold the solution for effective use and conservation of energy, and result in minimal harm to the world for future generations. An introduction with a few examples will be given in the talk on the group's energy research and applications and future directions as well.",
	"5": "When examining the current state of race relations compared to the state of race relations preceding the Civil Rights Movement, the progress made between the two eras and the hindrance of progress are questioned. Liberals blame structuralism for less progress: \"The system purposefully harms us. We have made attempts to make progress but the system constantly thwarts our attempts.\" Conservatives blame behaviorism: \"The problem is us: we do not watch the news, we are uninformed, and we do not vote and that hurts our progress.\" To investigate behaviorism, I have conducted research, including a survey, to measure the political awareness and political participation of African-American college students, groups possibly disenfranchised by Voter ID Laws. In North Carolina, 34% of 316,000 registered voters without a state-issued ID and 36% of 138,000 voters without IDs at the polls in 2012 were African-Americans. Some Voter ID Laws in the US accept gun licenses as forms of IDs instead of Student IDs. Based on the survey conducted, Black college students voice their political opinions through voting, demonstrations including marching, and volunteering in campaigns. Only 4% of surveyors are politically inactive and do not vote. Looking at analyses of the 2012 Presidential Election, Black Voter Turnout exceeded White Voter Turn-Out for the first time. Young, black women had the highest turnout of any minority group. 70% of surveyors pay attention to the news. 63% of surveyors believed that unfair legislation has passed but 65% of surveyors will continue to vote. Even if students do not plan to vote, 46% of surveyors will not become apathetic. The research indicates that structuralism hinders progress more than behaviorism.",
	"6": "It is possible to synthesize ZnO nanostructures that vary widely in both morphology and optical properties for use within many unique and important applications. The focus of this research has been to develop cheap, simple, scalable and smart substrate templates for nanowire growth through careful control of material structures and processing. Thus, understanding the physics of basic interactions within an Au/ZnO system is a very important first step.  In this poster presentation, we will report how the smart templates are fabricated and present initial findings in fundamental physics.",
	"7": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be very useful for early stage detection of cancer and provide valuable information on originating tumors. However, in order to analyze and culture CTCs, they must be removed from the blood stream. It has been demonstrated that a microfluidic channel can be effectively used to perform this task via external-magnetic-field-assisted cell selection and separation with cells tagged with magnetic nanoparticles. To further develop this microfluidic technology, we propose to use ZnO nanowires (NWs) functionalized with magnetic materials to serve as cell trapping sites. The NWs can effectively increase trapping volume within a three-dimensional architecture. In addition, we plan to analyze the trapped cells with both Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy, since ZnO NWs are very effective waveguide materials. In this poster, I will present some of our very first preliminary results on microfluidic device fabrication and testing.",
	"8": "Scientific research into developing more economic and performance efficient water desalination membranes is driven by the scarcity of adequate drinking water in poor and arid regions globally. Reverse Osmosis (RO) is the most widely water desalination method due its lower energy consumption when compared to other desalination techniques. This project seeks to synthesize polyamide-polyetheramide (PAPEA) thin film composite (TFC) membranes using p-phenylenediamine (PPD), trimesoyl chloride (TC) and an ether amine to improve the characteristics of the thin layer. Interfacial polymerization occurred at room temperature on the surface of a polysulfone support. The membrane was then soaked in DI water to prevent dehydration and Infrared Attenuated Total Reflectance (IR ATR) was conducted to verify polymer synthesis. Preliminary ATR analysis indicated that the PAPEA thin film layer was synthesized on the polysulfone support. These results will be further confirmed with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis and the membrane will be subjected to crossflow filtration testing to ascertain its water flux and salt rejection.",
	"9": "A University Counseling Center started the <b><i>Project Revive</i></b> project in response to the alarming number of suicide attempts and increased referrals for counseling during the 2012-13 academic year. <b><i>Project Revive</i></b> was designed to alleviate stress amongst the student body; thereby, possibly decreasing the number of campus suicide attempts. The plan, as the counseling staff, was to improve the student morale and decrease stress through campus events and workshops that were thought to be beneficial to students and faculty on campus. This study focuses on survey data to examine the relationship between support groups and student's emotional and/or mental well-being. Findings are based on forty one surveys administered to workshop participants during the fall 2013 semester. The survey was designed to measure the effectiveness. Results from the questionnaires reveal that programs/workshops affected the participants in a positive way.",
	"10": "The objective of, Fool's Gold, is to increase awareness of asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among African American college students in Nashville, TN. Fool's Gold also aims to inform college aged African Americans about the importance of regular testing. Through Fool's Gold, health education session will be conducted. Program participants will be connected with local health service organizations. Information gathered through this preliminary study will be used to develop an intervention that will result in an increased awareness of asymptomatic STIs, increase in regular STI testing, and ultimately lead to the decrease in risky sexual behaviors among college students.",
	"11": "This project was designed to inform African- American college students about the potential disease implications of obesity. Increasing knowledge, changing attitudes and behaviors allow students to make healthier decisions. With the assistance of community partners, a health awareness seminar was planned to address obesity. The event featured a health educator, a nutritionist and a meditation session hosted by a certified Tai Chi instructor. Pre- and post assessments were conducted to determine if the desired educational markers were met. Participants gained an understanding of healthy diets, exercise and maintaining proper weight in reducing or eliminating the onset of obesity related diseases.",
	"12": "Overall obesity rates have seen a slight decrease but the racial and ethnic disparities still exist amongst this population. Weigh Your Options is designed to positively impact obesity rates of African American youth ages 11 to 17, through educating and enabling them to make informed healthy decisions, As a result of participating in this intervention, participants will understand the importance of a healthy diet and exercise.",
	"13": "Thirty eight point six percent of public school students are obese or overweight. When obesity or overweight is not addressed, it can lead to health related diseases included hypertension, diabetes and heart disease. Through education of the students in a meaningful and fun awareness program, participants will have increased awareness of a healthy nutrition and exercise.",
	"14": "Dopamine is a biogenic amine which effects motor activity, reward and working memory. The synthesis pathway of dopamine begins with tyrosine to which the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase; known as cat-2 in <i>C. elegans</i>, is added to form L-dopa to which dopa-decarboxylase is added ultimately producing dopamine. When the synthesis pathway of dopamine is disrupted, such as there being a mutation in cat-2, no dopamine is produced. However when the dopamine transporter loses its function (dat-1 ok157) to be able to serve as a channel for dopamine reuptake, the access of dopamine will overstimulate motor neurons leading to paralysis. A SWIP Assay tests for swimming induced paralysis caused by the inhibition of motor neurons due to the lack of the dopamine transporter in <i>C. elegans</i>. The act of swimming causes dopamine to be released in <i>C. elegans</i> therefore in the absence of the dopamine transporter <i>C. elegans</i> will paralyze in water due to the overstimulation of motor neurons. A SWIP Assay can also test for swimming induced paralysis due to osmolarity. Osmolarity measures the number of solute particles per unit volume of solution (Osm/L). Ionic compounds such as sodium chloride dissociate in solution whereas non-ionic compounds like sucrose do not dissociate in solution. The effect of increasing osmolarity on a SWIP Assay using both wild-type (N2) and mutant (dat-1) <i>C. elegans</i> was also tested.",
	"15": "The purpose of this paper is to explore the factors that impact language learners in gaining literacy in their target language. Specifically, this paper looks at the transfer of literacy skills between students' first and second languages and the implications this has on current and future educational practices. Furthermore, this paper discusses the lack of conclusive research found in the field to determine the process by which one learns how to read in a second language. Thus, the purpose of this research is to investigate this issue further in an attempt to better seek out the accepted findings of second language literacy acquisition in the field and to identify gaps in the research that currently exist.",
	"16": "The resiliency, motivation, and ability to self-regulate that an individual expresses are all examples of self-efficacy. For students in higher education, their level of self-efficacy may ultimately be tested when they are met with foreign challenges and obstacles in their new environment. While self-efficacy is a concept widely accepted cross-culturally, this paper focuses on the self-efficacy of Latinos in higher education. Based on the theoretical framework as pioneered by Albert Bandura, this paper reviews literature that observes self-efficacy factors of Latinos in higher education that may contribute to disproportionate retention and graduation rates.",
	"17": "Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and this statistic is grimmer for African Americans. African American adults are fifty percent more likely to have a stroke than their white adults' counterparts. African Americans who suffer with obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol and diabetes are at an increased risk for stroke. Stroke of Genius is an intervention designed to increase awareness of stroke in low-income populations; identify three risk factors and the warning signs of stroke. Pre and post assessments were administered before and after the event. The goal of this study was to education one hundred participants about stroke prevention.",
	"18": "Obesity rates are steadily increasing in the United States. In many states, obesity rates have been lowered, but the rates are still frighteningly high, Tennessee is among them. Obesity can lead to other health issues, such as diabetes, high cholesterol, hypertension and stroke. Many initiatives have focused on changing diets and encouraging exercise to reduce obesity. Project Big Bone will explore another factor important in combating obesity among Black women. This research will explore the relationship between self-perception of body type and obesity among Black women",
	"19": "Infant mortality rates in the United States have seen a decline, but the rates in the African American community are still two times higher than those in the White and Hispanic communities. Infant mortality rates greatly impact African-American's because of factors such as stress, unawareness, and an unhealthy lifestyle. The focus of the project is to increase awareness, teach women on how to manage stress, and introduce them to a healthier lifestyle. ",
	"20": "Infant mortality is a health disparity that has become ubiquitous with African Americans. Infant Mortality rates in the African American community are two times higher than the rates in other communities. This initiative is designed to teach college-aged African American women about infant mortality and how a woman's overall health and wellness can contribute to the rates.",
	"21": "According to the Mayo Clinic, \"prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men.\" Prostate cancer is the leading cause of death among men not including skin cancer. Many African American men today are being diagnosed with prostate cancer. However, many are not aware of the symptoms, signs or steps to prevent the disease from developing. This project will serve to provide both men and women with information about prostate cancer and the roles that need to be played to bring about change.",
	"22": "Depression is common in people, especially women. It affects general health and can affect health of pregnant women and their unborn children. Untreated, maternal depression can impact a woman's ability to adequately care for her infant which may be detrimental to her infant's life. This study will investigate the state of depression in college women and their knowledge of depressions link to infant mortality. The sample will be taken from a liberal arts educational institution. Participants will primarily be African American college students.",
	"23": "Stroke is highly prevalent in the African-American population. African Americans have twice the risk for first time stroke when compared to whites. as individuals age, the risk increases. According to the Tennessee department of Health, cardiovascular diseases resulted in 6448.5 million in health expenditures and lost productivity in 2008.This intervention seeks to compare the cost of a gym membership and healthy eating to living with the efforts of stroke.",
	"25": "In the modern Romance languages, possession is typically expressed in one of two ways, i.e. with a possessive adjective/pronoun or with a preposition. Most of these languages have very well established patterns that can be observed in the selection of the mode of expression of these genitive constructions, which is often due to a well-established tradition of language standardization. However, what we observe in less commonly spoken Romance languages such as Picard is that these patterns are not as well concretized as in their more common counterparts and they may often use a completely different system for expressing the genitive. This paper examines genitive constructions of two closely related Romance varieties, French and Picard, to see in what ways these two languages are similar in their expression of the genitive and also in what ways they diverge from one another. We use descriptions provided by grammarians of the two varieties from various time periods to gain an historical perspective on the difference of these two languages. Finally we combine historical accounts with modern language data to determine not only how these languages' genitive constructions diverged, but also why this might have happened.",
	"26": "Colorism is an intra-racial discrimination based on skin color (Thompson and Keith, 2001).  For example, individuals with lighter complexions tend to receive preferential treatment and regard.  Understanding its dynamics and consequences is important because it helps to understand how prejudice amongst African Americans can impact them individually and collectively.  Specifically, we can discern whether and how intra-group discrimination such as colorism influences individual self-esteem in the African American community.  The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between colorism and self-esteem in young adults who identify as Black or African American.  Using a correlational design we will compare participants scores from the Implicit Associations Test (IAT) and an online self esteem survey measure to make determinations about the following:  1) the existence of  a relationship between scores and 2) if there is a difference between groups.  We hypothesize that participants will tend to preference lighter skin and participants in the dark skin group will have lower self-esteem scores regardless of preference. Finally, we believe that in terms of beauty, lighter skin, non kinky hair textured males and females are preferred.",
	"28": "Dopaminergic neurons are specialized cells in the brain that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine. This neurotransmitter is important for many functions in humans and other animals, including sleep, mood, learning and movement. In order for dopaminergic neurons to function properly, they must commit to a cell fate and express precise levels of  genes encoding signaling molecules and receptors for their response to stimuli. The choices neurons make to become a specific neuron type and express certain molecules is thought to be largely controlled by transcription factors, but only a handful of the factors are known. We have identified a likely role for a member of the conserved and developmentally important <i>forkhead</i> transcription factor family, <i>fkh-8</i>, in regulating the function of dopaminergic neurons.  Disruption of the <i>fkh-8</i> gene, which we have demonstrated is expressed in dopaminergic neurons, exhibit a swimming-induced paralysis phenotype indicative of altered levels of dopamine transport or production. To test our hypothesis that <i>fkh-8</i> regulates critical aspects of DA neuron function, I am carrying out pharmacological, genetic, and phenotypic analyses. This is significant because it may be possible to use <i>fkh-8</i> to help generate a program for dopamine neuron development, which could help with future studies to direct stem cells to a dopaminergic fate. This could potentially prevent or reverse diseases like Parkinson's, which is caused by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons.",
	"29": "<p>Harlem, New York is known for its connection to African American history, art, and culture. In a recent speech, director Spike Lee denounced the social changes in the neighborhood, as more white people move into predominantly black areas. He began by disagreeing with a New York Times article about the benefits of gentrification. He went on to raise basic questions related to the matter. \"Why did it take this great influx of white people to get the schools better? Why's the garbage getting picked up more regularly?\" [1] Lee's comments are related to a larger issue: what is the merit of gentrification?</p><p>Gentrification is \"the process of renewal and rebuilding accompanying the influx of middle-class or affluent people into deteriorating areas that often displaces poorer residents.\" [2] As communities begin to transition, a conversation arises about the changing environment. Local governments praise the added tax revenue in the area, and individuals laud the growth and expansion of the city. However, these sentiments do not include those of individuals who are forced to leave these areas. Frequently, the poorer residents are ignored and are further marginalized by others with more purchasing power.</p><p>This study will analyze the community changes in terms of population, ethnic diversity, household income, and changes in businesses.

	"30": "<p>Noble metal nanoparticles such as gold and silver have drawn a large amount of attention and have been intensely studied in recent years due to their unique properties in optics, electronics and biomaterials. Our work takes advantage of the photothermal effect of silver nanoparticle (Ag NPs) to build up new multilayered film for optical data storage. To this end, polystyrene (PS) capped silver nanoparticles with narrow size distribution and well dispersion in polymer matrix need to be prepared and well characterized, as well as certain important parameters in the course of synthesis have to be methodically studied.</p><p>Therefore, three thiol PS (Mn=5k, 13k and 23k) have been designed and synthesized via reversible addition-fragmentation living/controlled polymerization. PS capped Ag NPs of varied PS brush lengths and stoichiometric ratio of silver nitrate to PS ([Ag]: [PS-SH] 8:1, 16:1 and 32:1) were prepared in the presence of DMF, by superhydride reduction and characterized using ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).</p><p>The currently collected data displayed that 8:1, 16:1 are favorable ratios with little to no aggregation and an average particle size of 4nm, while 32:1 has a larger amount of aggregation with a wide range of particle sizes.</p>",
	"31": "Dopaminergic (DA) signaling is vital to normal locomotion, cognition, and mood regulation. A dysfunction in DA signaling can result in disorders such as Parkinson's disease, ADHD, and schizophrenia. Forkhead-8 (FKH-8) is a novel transcription factor in the nematode worm <i>C. elegans</i>. Our lab has shown that FKH-8 is enriched in DA neurons, and plays a role in DA signaling.  We hypothesize that FKH-8 may modulate dopamine transporter (DAT) activity. We used 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), a DAT specific neuro-toxic substrate, to assay for neurodegeneration, and to determined if a loss of FKH-8 alters DAT activity. When administered to worms whose neurons are marked by green-fluorescent protein (GFP), neuronal degeneration can be monitored by a loss of fluorescence. We originally predicted that DAT activity would be diminished in <i>fkh-8</i> mutants because <i>fkh-8</i> and dat mutants phenocopy DA-specific behaviors. Surprisingly, our preliminary data suggest that <i>fkh-8</i> mutants are sensitive to 6-OHDA toxicity. These findings indicate FKH-8 mutants foster heightened DAT activity. To expand upon our 6-OHDA experiments, RNA-Seq will be used to generate a cell-specific gene expression profile in FKH-8 mutants. DA neurons will be isolated from whole worm preparations using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The RNA-Seq data will be compared between strains with and without FKH-8 to assess changes in gene expression.  By examining FKH-8's regulatory capacity, we may uncover genes required for proper DA neuron function, and therefore new pharmaceutical targets designed to treat DA-related disorders.",
	"32": "Currently in the United States there are approximately 4.4 million undocumented immigrants under the age of 30 (Passel & Lopez, 2012) who are facing a constant threat of deportation and the inability to pursue many of their dreams (Castro-Salazar & Bagley, 2010; DeGenova, 2010; Torres & Wicks-Asbun, 2013). To humanize the debate on immigration and challenge narratives of illegality, we collected stories of undocumented youths' experiences in the U.S. A research team comprised of individuals from Fisk University and the Tennessee Immigrant Refugee Rights Coalition (TIRRC) are conducting a participatory action research project in which all members of the research team designed a semi-structured interview protocol and proceeded to interview 19 undocumented youth. We found that many undocumented youth face hardships in acquiring basic social needs such as, driver's licenses, healthcare, and a college education. However, we also found that there are many stories of resilience and empowerment resulting in engagement in activism. We suggest that although undocumented youth face social inequities, they are determined to change exclusionary and oppressive policies.",
	"33": "The teaching process has been developing and growing over the years to better adapt with the variety of students in the world. Every teacher and /or student of a subject has his or her own unique way of learning and instructing. When speaking of teaching an instrument, more specifically string based instruments, there are a variety of ways to approach a lesson. My goal through this research is to find better ways to understand your student and their personality so adjustments can be made to the more general approach of teaching strings. The new lesson plans will incorporate methods for teaching more visual learning students as well as methodical or idealistic learning styles. With this new more personal level of instruction, whatever lesson you are trying to teach your student he or she will appreciate and have that much better understanding of the newly learned skill or technique. My research will include pre-designed lesson plans for different learning styles to show how students interpret information differently and apply their new skill set. These lesson plans will help guide other instructors in finding new and improved methods of teaching their student. With this new structure for teaching strings, a pupil will have a better understanding of the subject matter as well as show improvement in their overall playing ability. The desired outcome for my research will result in students playing and enjoying their instruments longer while reaping the psychological and emotional benefits of learning a musical instrument.",
	"34": "<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is a bacterium that infects almost every part of the human body and a common cause of skin infections, food poisoning and respiratory diseases. The emergence of antibiotic-resistance forms of pathogenic S. aureus and its involvement in hospital-acquired infections presents a significant problem to modern healthcare. For <i>S. aureus</i> to survive and replicate in the host, it must acquire essential nutrients.  In the immune response, the host combats invading pathogens by limiting the availability of essential nutrients such as the transition metal manganese. Due to the highly adaptive nature of bacteria, pathogens have evolved in order to overcome the host defense mechanisms. For example, <i>S. aureus</i> has two Mn-dependent superoxide dismutases (Sod A and Sod M), which are known to be virulence factors. However, the molecular mechanism of this redundant enzymatic system remains unknown.<p>In order to understand the structure function relationships of Sod A and Sod M in <i>S. aureus</i>, we employed a computational comparative modeling approach. We generated homology models of both Sod A and Sod M using the known protein structures of homologous SODs from other organisms on the SWISS Model server. A detailed sequence level and structural comparison between S. aureus SODs and those of other bacteria such as <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> reveal that although the overall fold of SODs is the same, subtle differences in sequence structural conformation may provide insight into the mechanism of SOD action.</p>",
	"35": "Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) is a very powerful tool which has the ability to optically image nanostructures, measure surface topology and map out interactions between the nanostructure and the probe. We image the Nano crystals by optically exciting them with a laser and view their photoluminescence on a CCD camera. The scanning probe technique used is called Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). This technique measures the interaction force between the surface and the tip of the probe potentially giving Nano scale resolution. This research is aimed at developing a multi-touch system that we can use to demonstrate the intuitive interface between the SPM and simple hand gestures. The program languages needed for the interface include python, a platform like pyMT or Kivy to run the module, lab view and C++. Our goal at the end is to develop a multi-touch system that we can use to analyze and control the SPM by gestures.",
	"36": "Dopaminergic (DA) neurons are important for a wide array of functions such as motor control, behavior, cognition, and mood. Defects of DA neuron function can lead to serious neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, ADHD, and drug addiction. An important factor in dopaminergic neuron function is proper fate specification and maintenance through transcriptional control of dopaminergic neuron-specific genes. Finding transcription factors that are involved in regulating dopaminergic neuron gene expression could help us understand how dopaminergic neurons are made, leading to better potential therapies. We are using the model organism <i>C. elegans</i> to study a forkhead family transcription factor, FKH-8, which is expressed in dopaminergic neurons. Other work in our lab has shown a dopamine-dependent phenotype in fkh-8 deletion mutants. We originally hypothesized that FKH-8 may regulate the expression of the dopamine transporter gene, dat-1.

Breast cancer is an uprising epidemic amongst African American women. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among black women aged 45-64. Black women are an understudied population that is predisposed to vitamin D deficiency and to more advanced stages of breast cancer at diagnosis. Previous research has suggested that there is a link between higher vitamin D levels and lower mammographic breast density. The higher the breast density level, the more likely one is to develop breast cancer. There have been other studies on the relationship between breast cancer and vitamin D; however the question of why are underserved women at a higher risk of developing breast cancer, has yet to be successfully answered. Some reasons may be due to a lack of knowledge or to poor nutrition. Most of the data for this research is from a compilation of prior research studies, and analyzing these results. Much literature review and a detailed analysis of the results were performed to update and further the research. With this research, hopefully a better understanding of the correlation between vitamin D levels and the development of breast cancer in medically underserved black women will be gained.",

The psychological concept that is under investigation is the concept of modeling. Using this theory we hypothesized that participant's whose parents attended or graduated from a college or university will be more likely to delay gratification after undergraduate studies, and attend graduate school. Moreover, we also examined other variables such as socioeconomic status, classification, grades, income, and their effects on a student's decision to delay gratification. We collected data from 33 students from diverse backgrounds and classifications. A small sample size limited the conclusions that could be drawn from this study however; the study raises important questions for future studies. This research could be used as a guide to encourage further research on a larger scale.",

Biomedical approaches to prevention, such as early identification and usage of medication, help to reduce the number of new infections substantially. Recently enormous advances in HIV/AIDS treatment regimens have fundamentally changed the natural history of the disease and have sharply reduced HIV-related morbidity and mortality in countries where such treatments are available. Along with treatment, equally important is the influence of human behavior on the spread and the control of infectious disease, as in case of pandemic influenza, the effect of pseudo-rational opposition to vaccines. If through effective public education campaign, people's behavior towards prevention measures will change then it will deeply affect the dynamics of the epidemics and the endemics. In this talk, I will present a mathematical model of epidemic management developed with the inclusion of these two dynamic effects as two control measures. Optimal Control Theory and the forward-backward sweep method are used on the system of differential equations to achieve the goal of 1. Minimize the infected population and 2. Slow down the epidemic outbreak.<p>In conclusion, I will highlight on my research involvement in biomathematics, my collaborators and my students' achievements in biomathematics research, and finally our recent initiatives at Fisk in developing a Bio-track curriculum.</p>",

Parachutes today are round and fairly stable, made of a heavy nylon fabric and a static line. While the materials and structure of this tool have changed, the basic mathematics and mechanics of the fall are still only understood at the most basic level. Differential equations, with the use of software like Mathematica can be used to model a varying amount of problems. This experiment will employ differential equations to model the Parachute Problem. The value of the terminal velocity, time for the diver to hit the ground, and the distance traveled before and after the parachute deployment can be determined using a system of mathematical equations and the principles of falling body.",

CZT's advantages include high energy resolution for gamma radiation and ambient-temperature operation. However, fabrication of large volume CZT crystals remains difficult, as current CZT growth techniques result in crystals with defects and other nonuniformities in composition. This poses challenges in isolating which factors contribute the most to overall detector performance. Detector performance factors are not fully understood, but three important factors within the crystal volume can be identified: concentration of zinc, location and size of tellurium inclusions, and internal stress regions. The goal of this project is to conduct a fully battery of characterization techniques to correlate these physical features to detection performance.",

But there is not a primary strategy on which route to pursue in relation to the circuit of cities that the teams have to travel. The framework behind the team's travelling system reveals that the teams travel in their own directions to several cities and states to promote the university's athletic department, which it does, but it also causes the department expenses to increase due to the inconsistency of distances and lack of controlled travel range. In this thesis, we re-introduce the concept of genetic algorithm through the Travelling Salesman Problem, using its evolution of genes procedure to generate the best routes for each team to travel the minimum amount of miles. We chose the technique of genetic algorithm because it is efficient when dealing with complex problems. It can reduce the initial distance by approximately 44.5% after processing several times to generate the best distance. We implemented a body of codes that continuously executes and stores the total distances of each route created to display the results in descending order where the smallest number of distance is the best route. We expect this new approach to be beneficial to the university's athletic department as well as others who may encounter this problem because it finds the shortest route to travel which reduces the rate of money loss drastically.",

Book keeping is a good practice but should be secondary reference because it slows down the production, is likely to be less efficient and can become unorganized if a lot of errors were made as opposed to using a form of technology. The framework behind the small food businesses reveals that manual book keeping is preferred because most of the owners do not have the tools to create an app or knowledge on how to maintain a food business based android app. We re-introduce visual-tile based coding through the Pizza Party with Fusion Table tutorial that appInventor2 provides. The tutorial codes forming the foundation are useful to the project because they allow us to construct an efficient data processing and storage android app that records names, orders, time, date and background accounting all in one click. We test the coding through appInventor2 error check icon that displays that the code is currently functioning. Following completion of the android food app, tests will run on an android operated device to see the full implementations. We expect this new approach to be useful to small food businesses owners because it is fast, saves time and provides mass storage, hence it is more efficient than manual book keeping.",
	"44": "In rocketry there are many different computer applications. The application that is used in this research is a website called Rocksim which is used to project how high in altitude a rocket can go. The problems with these motors on this application and some others are that different motors that are designed for the different model rockets are not tested adequately and once the motors are inserted into the rocket, the actual thrust of the rocket either isn't as powerful as, or more powerful than the application portrays. The people who invented the rocket motors have tested them in model rockets, but there are a few modifications that have to be made in the efficiency of the tests. One of the approaches that have been taken to clear up confusion about the rocket motors is to test the rockets on a platform that is placed on a force plate. The plates are then attached to the ground, and the thrust is read on a scale. A thrust curve is then matched with the efficiency of the motor and determines thrust as a function of time. An assumption that is frequently made during the research is that the altitude of the rocket is dependent on the size of the rocket and the thrust of the motor as shown on Rocksim. The impact of the research will implement another way of efficiently testing motors without physically going to a launch site and not knowing the power of the motor.",

It consisted of 74 students from Fisk University, with a survey of 25 open and closed-ended questions that consisted of demographics, attitudes, and beliefs on online dating and behaviors on relationships. This was based on length of relationships, intimate and friendships and point of entry of the respondent's relationship. Major findings included the point of entry with relationships states that relationships last longer in a traditional, face-to-face setting, than an online or web-based setting. 65% never had an online relationship, and only 5% had a relationship online for a year.

Using an experimental design, the Keirsey Temperament Sorter (KTS2) (1996) was used to determine the participants' temperaments. This temperament sorter classified four temperaments: Artisan, Guardian, Idealist, & Rational. The participants were given food incentives and an opportunity to gain more incentives or lose all of their incentives in a game of chance.

Most of these schools have adopted a multi-faceted, community service model (i.e., offering social services for students and their families as well as education), which operates under the assumption that student's educational attainment is influence by issues beyond the classroom. Using Brofenbrenner's ecological theory, our research examines the relationship between community engagement and educational outcomes. Ecological theory focuses on the impact that environment plays on the growth and development of an individual.  Through case study design, we examined how <b><i>Urban Preparatory Academy</i></b> located in a large Midwestern metropolitan area promotes successful educational attainment by providing its alumni extended community services throughout college.  Data from organizational artifacts and surveys from 15 former students were analyzed. The data illustrated that the school provided several vital services for college success such as: financial resources, social networks, mentors, etc. Additionally, the data revealed that alumni utilized most services during college matriculation and believed that Urban Prep Academy does in fact culminate in the alumnus success in college as stated.  Implications for program design are discussed.",

The ability to identify mutations affecting their proteins, structures, and characterization of their genotypes and phenotypes at the cellular and molecular levels help to display the various interactions relevant to the human being (Introduction to <i>C. elegans</i>). Dopamine is an important neuromodulator in both vertebrates and invertebrates. It has been found that reduced dopamine signaling can cause a distinct abnormality in the behavior of the <i>C. elegans</i>, which has only eight dopaminergic neurons. In <i>C. elegans</i>, an excess of synaptic dopamine results in a loss of movement in water, which is known as Swimming-Induced Paralysis (SWIP). Mutants defective in dopamine signaling also frequently exhibited both abnormally high and low average speeds, ultimately causing paralysis. Swimming Induced Paralysis allows researchers to determine the mutant genes that cause dopamine signaling.

	"50": "<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is a bacterial pathogen that poses risks to human health varying from mild infections to mortality. Bacterial infections are often treated with antibiotics. However, several S. aureus strains, such as MRSA, have become antibiotic resistant, thus highlighting an emerging problem of global health concern. This research is grounded in the hypothesis that understanding the molecular mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis will reveal targeted strategies for developing new antibiotics. This project focuses on the redundancy of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes in S. aureus and their role in virulence. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) protect cells from oxidative damage by reducing superoxides,  a highly reactive oxygen species that is extremely toxic biologically, to oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and water. SODs require metal cofactors to function. In most bacteria, such as E. coli, several SODs are expressed, each requiring a metal cofactor such as Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, or Zn. However, <i>S. aureus</i>  expresses two SODs (SodA and SodM) which both require manganese as a cofactor. The overarching hypothesis is that this redundancy in Mn-SOD can be explained by subtle structural differences between SodA and SodM that lead to functional differences. In order to address this question, high-resolution x-ray crystallographic studies will be performed. A nickel affinity purification protocol was developed to purify SodA and SodM to >95% homogeneity. Finally, vapor diffusion experiments resulted in preliminary microcrystals. Together, these results represent an important first step toward high-resolution structural determination of SodA and SodM.",

It also explores the cultural and sociopolitical factors that make urban education distinct from all other forms as a method by which the needs of the students are met intellectually, culturally and socially. Many researchers have given account for the economic impact that redlining and gentrification have had on the academic performance of urban children while ignoring the impact of the social and cultural ignorance in educational policy-making and have subsequently missed a very important part of the measurement of academic growth and its influences. By denying the opportunity for social and cultural inclusion in curriculum alongside economic equity between urban students and their suburban/rural counterparts, the system of education in America has continually failed its urban students and will continue to do so. Language and literacy are the most common resources by which the educational gap can be filled but it is also the most neglected in favor of other subjects by which support may come. By providing more curricular opportunities to for the cultivation of Language Arts in a way that is culturally relevant to urban students, more research can be done to explore how to best serve them and achieve greater academic excellence.",
	"52": "Dopamine (DA) signaling is critical to normal functioning in humans, regulating behaviors such as learning, memory, reward, and motor control. Disruption of DA signaling is associated with a variety of conditions including Parkinson's disease, depression, and schizophrenia. Caenorbditis elegans is a common model system used to study dopamine signaling, largely due its genetic simplicity and rapid reproductive capacity. The DA signaling pathway of <i>C. elegans</i> has been greatly elucidated in recent years, and a host of associated genes have also been identified. In this study, we examine the role of the dopamine transporter gene dat-1 as well as the presynaptic degenerin/epithelial (DEG/ENaC) sodium channel gene asic-1 in DA signaling. We use the swimming-induced paralysis (SWIP) assay to evaluate the behavioral phenotype of dat-1(ok157) and asic-1(415) mutants whose associated genes have been rendered dysfunctional. SWIP will occur when there is over-stimulation of motor neurons. This study reaffirms that dat-1(ok157) significantly increases the occurrence of SWIP relative to the wildtype; paralysis can be reduced by exposing the worm to sucrose. Finally, asic-1(ok415) partially reduces the paralysis seen in dat-1(ok157) mutants when introduced concomitantly. Our results indicate that DAT is required for the termination of DA signaling. Furthermore, since the disruption of ASIC-1 channel activity helps terminate DA signaling and its associated paralysis, ASIC-1 most likely enhances DA release in wildtype animals.",

When trying to detect celestial objects in space and sending satellites to image them it cost tons of fuel therefore costing more money. So there is a need to help save money in the NASA program. Even though NASA may have an algorithm on how to obtain the best routes to minimize distance there can always be a better solution to improve their methodology. In order to tackle this problem we are using Simulated Annealing, or SA, and the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSA) as an example. SA allows us to find the best local optimums. Using Simulated Annealing and TSA together we find the best routes for a salesman to tour a number of cities while reducing the distance and/or cost. In this research, the cities represent the celestial objects, and the minimal distance, or route, represents the cost function.

The assembly of genomes is further complicated by errors occurred while reading fragments. In this work, we present the Genetic Algorithm (GA) that is able to assemble DNA sequence from smaller fragments of DNA. It also handles the error that that occurs while reading a smaller reads of DNA. Initially, A preprocessing algorithm is used in order to combine highest overlapping fragments and reduce the amount of data subjected. After the preprocessing step, fragments that do not have single overlap are excluded. These excluded fragments account for the positive errors, fragments that are not part of the original sequences. In GA, each chromosome is encoded with a possible order of fragments representing a solution and a pool of chromosomes (population) is selected at random without repetition. The fitness of each chromosome is based on the contiguous overlap between the fragments in the chromosome and the length of the fragments in chromosome. For a given population size (e.g. 2500), the process is repeated several hundred times (generations) until the change in fitness is below minimal threshold. The efficiency of the proposed GA is validated by reassembling the DNA sequence of dorsophila fkh. The results show that the proposed GA could be used with longer and more random fragments of DNA to efficiently assemble a DNA sequence.",

CP contributes to the control of pathogens by sequestration of nutrient metals which serves to inhibit microbial growth. A detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of this immune response will inform the development of new antimicrobial therapies which are critical in light of increasing antibiotic resistance among human pathogens. A highly interdisciplinary approach combining biophysical, biochemical, and microbiological methodologies demonstrate that CP binds the transition metals manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) with nanomolar affinity and this metal binding results in direct antimicrobial activity. The high resolution x-ray crystal structure of Mn bound CP determined to 1.6 angstroms resolution reveals an unprecedented Mn coordination site comprised of six histidine residues arranged in a perfect octahedral geometry. Mutants of CP with redacted metal binding properties were used to dissect the relative contributions of Mn and Zn sequestration in CP's antimicrobial activity. The results show that Mn sequestration by CP is required for maximal antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens.",

Black women did not fit the standards of American beauty, but as they progressed in the areas of political and social equality, from Reconstruction to the 21<sup>st</sup>century, they subsequently achieved much more than what many naysayers thought. During the 1920s until the 1950s, Black women had to overcome not only racial oppression but also backlash from Black men about beauty, the standard of beauty, who was to define that standard of beauty, and beauty as an economic industry operated primarily by men, regardless of the product.   <p>Black women developed skin bleaching agents, hair straightening systems, and makeup in an effort to fit the White and Black male standard of beauty. In discovering and creating their own standards and methods to achieve beauty, Black women also obtained money, power, and respect through their inventions, businesses, financial gains, and most important the freedom to meet their own standards of beauty in a society where they did not fit the mold of beauty.</p>",

It could be argued that this is no longer a problem since the internet is now readily accessible to a greater percentage of the populace; and even easier for those who own portable smart devices. However, not everybody has a smart phone, tablet, or a laptop. Also for those who own these devices, there are times when difficulties arise in accessing the internet for information. These problems are the basis on which InfoDaily, a web application, is developed. InfoDaily delivers information on demand - regardless of any technical difficulties. As long as a user is subscribed to the application and has a working cellphone number, information will be available to that user. InfoDaily will disseminate financial data, weather data, news and sports updates. This is made possible by making API calls to the related databases and then sending the data from the query to users through Twilio's SMS API. Core HTML was used to design the front end and Javascript, Node.js, and jQuery were used for the backend to query, format, parse, and send the data from the API calls. Currently, InfoDaily only delivers financial data to users. User-defined stock market quotes are pulled from Yahoo Finance's database, parsed, and sent out via text messaging after the stock market closes every day.",

But a problem arises, when fans waste useful resources because they cannot find optimal routes to go through all the parks/stadia and return home. Although several algorithms and techniques such as Brute force, linear programming, dynamic programming have been used to tackle this problem, their time complexities are quite large and for this reason these algorithms are considered infeasible for the problem. In this research, we would be using a heuristic search technique called the Genetic Algorithm. The genetic algorithm uses the evolutionary idea of using an initial population to generate better population but in this case, an initial result to generate better results and finally an optimal result. We ran the genetic algorithm technique several times changing several parameters and found that in each case, the genetic algorithm ran considerably faster than other techniques and also produced better results. We expect that this technique would use less computing power and also help people get better travelling routes in a far promptly time.",
	"74": "<i>Background</i>: Dopamine is a neurotransmitter responsible for a host of functions in animals from cognition to arousal and even motor control. In patients with Parkinson's disease, the neurons that produce dopamine die and therefore these areas are left uncontrolled. As a result, people with the disease begin to shake uncontrollably (a hallmark behavior of the disease). In <i>C. elegans</i>, a dopamine dependent phenotype known as swimming induced paralysis (SWIP) has been observed in worms with a knock-out of the dopamine transporter (DAT), a channel that recycles dopamine (DA) back into the pre-synaptic terminal. A worm undergoing SWIP shows no movement. In humans with low levels of dopamine and in worms with high levels of dopamine (it's not being recycled into the pre-synaptic terminal in dat-1 mutant worms), we see loss of motor control. Our goal was to prevent paralysis of the <i>dat-1</i> mutant worm.<p><i>Methods</i>: Our data were acquired from the SWIP assay which requires picking worms for two minutes and placing them in a drop of water in a multi-well glass plate for nine minutes. At the end of nine minutes, we observed the worms to see how many were paralyzed and how many were still swimming.</p><p><i>Results</i>: When combined with the <i>dop-3</i> knockout (as a <i>dat-1</i>; <i>dop-3</i> double mutant), the <i>dat-1</i> worms did not paralyze and swam at levels consistent with N2 (wild type) worms.</p><p><i>Conclusions</i>: The dop-3 receptor is critical to binding DA and is the receptor responsible for the SWIP phenotype. When it is knocked out (of a <i>dat-1</i> worm), the worm regains its motor control. Hopefully, this will lead to method of Parkinsons' patients regaining their motor control.</p>",
	"75": "The medical field is quickly expanding. As people attempt to push the assumed boundaries of life longevity, medical research continues to find new cures for what was once thought to be incurable diseases. These cures are only valuable when dosage research is conducted alongside it so that the drug can be effective yet non-toxic. In this research study, a pharmacokinetic mathematical model was developed to observe different dosing regimens to determine the effects of a loading dose. A loading dose is simply the initial dose which varies from the doses thereafter. Pharmaceutically-relevant parameters for the drug were determined from the experimentally established data of the drug. Computation and simulation was performed using Mathematica. Loading dosage formulas were developed through the use of limits, other mathematical properties that were applicable, and biological principles. The time between each dose was made constant and was discovered through mathematical processes for each drug. The study shows inferior levels of initial efficiency for regimens without loading doses while those containing such dosage display a certain amount of efficiency that can be guaranteed throughout its administration. With this variation in initial dosage it becomes theoretically possible to keep the drug perfectly potent throughout its maximum possible effective time. When restricting the initial dose with known biological principles of safe medical practices, thus making it practical for actual administration, the drug will still maintain a very high level of efficiency throughout its application without ever becoming toxic.",
	"76": "In this work, we discuss how to achieve a shortest possible route that student tour guides and prospective students can take to visit all key college facilities including dorm halls, lecture halls, library, research laboratories, during a campus tour. Finding the shortest path when given a list of places(nodes) and the distances between each pair has been a hard problem to solve computationally and is humanly impossible since the algorithm for TSP increases superpolynomially (or exponentially) with the number of places(nodes). Nevertheless, we used Simulated Annealing which is one of the most efficient algorithms in Computer Science to calculate the best route to take. How the algorithm works is to first have an objective function, which is to minimize the length of the journey (the sum of the distances between all the nodes in a specified order). Thereafter, we followed a three-step protocol, namely: 1) Configuration setting: This is the permutation of the nodes from 1 to N, given in all orders. Selecting an optimal one between these permutations is our aim. 2) Rearrangement strategy: here we replace sections of the path, and replace them with random ones to retest if this modified one is optimal or not. 3) The objective function (which is the aim of the minimization): This is the sum of the distances between all the cities for a specific order. After an iterative implementation of these three steps, our approach produces the optimal/shortest route that makes the campus tour less time-consuming and efficient.",

For this reason, the focus study and problem is to model the basic functions of the brain: sorting, storing, and recalling information. For this study, a computer program was developed to represent such functions. In this program a random set of memories were generated for this study on a scale from 1 to 50. These values were sorted into Binary Search Trees thus also sorting the memories. These trees were considered to only contain permanent memories therefore the memories cannot be replaced, only shifted. New memories were then added randomly firstly occupying a temporary tree in which the values can be swapped and deleted. Once these memories have reached a certain significance value it will be pushed into a permanent tree. Afterwards, a retrieval program runs to find certain memories. If the memory is found its value slightly increases, if not the value of the other memories decrease so that the memory may move closer to the root node so that on the next attempt it has a higher chance of being found. <p>Although this program does not take every factor into consideration, it describes the basic processes such that several phenomena such as temporarily forgetting, sudden remembrance, instinctual reactions and much more can be easily explained. The acquired data suggests that there are strong correlations between the amount of times a memory is recalled and its retrieval rates.</p>",

Each of the two materials alone has different thermal properties from the other. The goal is to model how these thermal properties vary depending on the <b><i>amount</i></b> of each material present in the mixture, and the <b><i>way</i></b> the materials are mixed. Mathematica is used to visualize how the thermal properties vary depending on the different <b><i>proportions</i></b> of the two materials and how they are arranged. The first case studied is the alternate stacking of the two materials, called \"1\" and \"2\". Materials 1 and 2 are a general representation of two materials with different properties. In the second case, the materials are stacked, with the second layer being a mixture of the two materials. The third case entails stacking the two materials with an intermediate area of mixing. The graphs shown depict  <b><i>thermal conductivity</i></b> \"H\" for Case B as a function of \"f\", which is a parameter related to the amount of material 2 compared to material 1.

Previous companies have failed at finding an answer to this problem, and still struggle today to come up with a better way to address this problem manually. We have used a Genetic Algorithm to optimize the best routes for delivery guys in order to reduce the time it takes to get to a destination in a timely manner.

To determine the best materials for detection and there specific properties, there must be test in which these detectors can be evaluated. At Fisk there are two main devices used to perform such evaluations: Osprey and Lynx. These two devices gather data from the detectors and translate it into meaningful information that generally is only accessible to computers to which they are directly connected. This necessary connection to a computer makes both the system and the data static or non-portable. By using a small router, the system for detection analysis becomes much smaller and the data is accessible through indirect connections. This only made it available to nearby computers but by using a remote desktop control program the information is accessible from anywhere if two Wi-Fi connections can be used at once. This is generally impossible but by using a fairly unknown program called Microsoft's Virtual Wi-Fi it becomes possible. With this extra connection a user can both remote into the laptop within the Osprey's or Lynx's proximity but also with the Osprey or Lynx itself thus controlling the experiment. These advances help make the detection system a more portable and ideal.",

Genetic Algorithm (GA) is commonly used to obtain approximate solutions for time consuming hard problems. In GA, a random set of positions is taken to create a path. The path is evolved using techniques of natural evolution, so that after a number of generations, a significantly more efficient route is obtained.

	"86": "Zinc oxide has emerged as one of the most promising optoelectronic materials due to its wide, direct bandgap of 3.37 eV and large exciton binding energy of 60 meV. These properties yield a more efficient near-UV emitter at elevated temperatures than the widely used semiconductor GaN. Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra for ZnO exhibit a sharply defined exciton recombination peak centered at 3.3 eV and a broad visible defect peak centered around 2.3 eV. Through different growth, annealing, and doping conditions, ZnO emission has been tuned for a wide range of optoelectronic devices, including LEDs, lasers, and sensors. However, one of the most effective methods for selective enhancement of ZnO PL is through coupling of localized surface plasmons of metal nanoparticles to the ZnO luminescent centers. In this research, ZnO nanowires are decorated with Ag nanoparticles, with an insulating MgO interlayer used to differentiate plasmon-mediated emission due to hot-electron transfer from that due to local field effects. In addition, at specific MgO thicknesses, Fabry-Perot resonators within the core-shell nanowires result in dramatic enhancement of the band-edge PL while the visible emission remains unaffected. Plasmonic coupling between the Ag nanoparticles and the ZnO luminescent centers then further enhances the near-UV emission, establishing the metal-nanoparticle-decorated core-shell nanowire architecture as a strong candidate for efficient optoelectronic applications.",
	"88": "Dopamine is a neurotransmitter used in many important day-to-day functions (such as voluntary movements, thought processes, learning, and mood control) in humans and other animals. The neurons that produce and regulate the amount of dopamine that is released must develop correctly and maintain appropriate levels of all the genes involved in regulating dopamine (many of which are still not understood). Loss or improper regulation of these neurons can lead to disorders such as Parkinsons's disease, ADHD, schizophrenia, and drug addiction, so understanding the genes involved in normal function could help us to decipher or treat these disorders. In order to test what genes might be involved in the regulation of these neurons and dopamine levels, we have turned to the model organism <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, a microscopic worm that despite a very different anatomy still shares the fundamental molecular and genetic properties of the dopamine signaling system found in humans. This worm's relative simplicity, transparent body, fast life cycle, and wealth of genetic resources make it a great system that we can experimentally manipulate to discover new genes involved that may be relevant to human health. Using this strategy, we have discovered a transcription factor, named FKH-8, which is found in dopamine-producing neurons and is necessary for normal dopamine-dependent behaviors. We are in the process of further identifying how this factor works and what target genes it may regulate. These efforts may uncover new factors that have important counterparts in humans",

After decades of attempting to find a way to do Boolean logic with zero energy, two independent ways, Directed Logic (DL) and GOLE (Generalized Optical Logic Elements) to achieve the goal was found. Both solutions were optical for obvious reasons: light is self-propagating and has numerous kinds of passive components that can be used. However, both DL and GOLE elements are difficult to composite as their inputs and outputs are encoded with difficulty types of physical signals.

The purpose of this outreach is to enhance achievement and urban youth through engaging them with stem curriculum in the areas of rocketry and astronomy. This model rocket has attained an altitude of 1800 feet carrying a robot payload as well as the after mentioned experiments. Atmospheric data was successfully collected and used for analysis.",
	"105": "We live in tumultuous times confronted by a set of challenges that demand our fullest attention and yet the mainstream media seems near obsessed with stories whose impact might readily (at the risk of sounding insensitive) be considered trivial. At a time when time is dually of the essence - one, because we literally only have a minute for the news and two, because time is not on our side, we have to resist the media's framing of reality and act. Growing income inequalities, the rule of special interests, environmental doom, and the continued marginalization of certain demographics (domestically as well as internationally) just to name a few, are issues that cannot wait for us to emerge from our current slumber. As members of the academy, I think we are faced with the somewhat precarious task of needing to remind one another and most importantly students of the importance of activism.  Precarious because as the saying goes, teachers are those who cannot do and yet, it seems, time is ripe for things to be done differently.",
	"106": "In this poster, we review the progress of Fisk Research Symposium over many years, 1998-2014. We analyze data based on year, discipline, department, and school. The work would be beneficial in identifying the potential challenges for future events.",
