# fisk-research-symposium

This is a [web application](http://sajidfisk.com/frs19/#/) that I wrote for Fisk University when I was a student there. This application allowed students to submit abstracts for the Fisk Research Symposium. Fisk Research Symposium is an annual program where hundreds of students present their research and their findings to faculties, fellow students, and mentors. 

Before this inhouse application was created, Fisk Research Symposium organizers used [Easy Chair](https://easychair.org/) to allow students to submit their abstract. Easy Chair had many limitations as organizers had very little control over how it works and how it manages the data. There were many functionalities like uploading the poster for printing, historical view of the abstract submissions, to name the few that organizers wanted but that were missing in Easy Chair. 

As a result, I, with help of My CS Professor, Sajid Hussain designed and implemented this application that was used in FRS 2016 for the first time. 

This project is written using `php` in the back end and `angularjs` in front. MySQL was used as the database.
