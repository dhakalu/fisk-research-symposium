# fisk-research-symposium

This is an web application that I wrote for Fisk University when I was a student there. This application allowed students to submit abstracts for the Fisk Research Symposium. Fisk Research Symposium is an annual program where hundreds of students present their research and their findings to faculties, fellow students, and mentors. 

Before this inhouse application was created, Fisk Research Symposium was using EasyChair application to allow students to submit their abstract. This had many limitations as we had very little control over how it works and how it manages the data. I, with help of My CS Professor, Sajid Hussain designed and implemented this application. 

Through this project is written using `php` in back end and `angularjs` in front. MySQL was used as the database.
